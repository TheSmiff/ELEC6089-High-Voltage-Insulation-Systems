\section{Overview of Grading Methods}
Failure of a bushing can damage the power transformer it is protecting, which can be an expensive mistake \cite{warne2005newnes}.
Bushings are required to withstand Electrical, Mechanical and Thermal stresses as defined in the IEEE standard C57.19.00 \cite{1440990}.
The design of the bushing is largely determined by the insulation material chosen and the resolution of these conflicting sources of stress.
Electrical stress is the particular focus of this report.

As the conductor passes through the casing, very high levels of electrical stress is seen in the bushing.

Electric field stress control is important in the design of many power system elements, especially cable terminations and bushings \cite{james2008condition}.
