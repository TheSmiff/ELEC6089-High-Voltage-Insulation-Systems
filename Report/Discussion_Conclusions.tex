\section{Discussion} \label{s:Discussion}
As has been outlined in this report so far, there are problems inherent within bushing design and multiple solutions to these problems. A full discussion and comparison will be made to determine the most accurate and reliable model for HV bushing design. Additionally, reasoning and justification for the incremental changes will outline the development of bushing and possible further improvements that could be made in design.

\subsection{Success Criteria}
In section 2 four criteria were mentioned to determine the efficacy of the design: general/intrinsic breakdown defined by the radial field, surface discharge defined by the axial field, partial discharge within the material defined by areas of high tangential field and corona discharge within air. 

Regarding general breakdown it is the largest breakdown strength of the model and so the least likely to fail. High Voltage Engineering Fundamentals has it defined as well in excess of  1MV/cm \cite{kuffel2000high}. The area of interest for this intrinsic breakdown is the line from the conductor straight to the flange, and a measurement of radial electric field.

Surface discharge is not as readily defined for typical graded designs, however a comparison can be made from shedding specifications. Shedding increases the effective creepage length of the bushing by a factor of 4 and for a typical design 40mm/kV is given as the required length for the operational voltage \cite{HVEngandTesting}.

Fortunately and reasonably given its significance, partial discharge inception voltage is well defined for all types of insulation material. For resin-impregnated paper the value is 36kV/cm and for oil-impregnated paper the value is 45kV/cm, justifying the more common use of OIP \cite{HVEngandTesting}. Due to its nature, a simple investigation of trends is not sufficient to estimate areas of possible PD origins and areas of interest must be found and tested against the inception voltage. They are typically located at the edges of foils or near the conductor itself.

Corona discharge can occur in both air and oil, however, since the inception voltage is much lower for air and the effects of weather and pollution affect the air side of the bushing much greater it is of higher importance. For the discussion, it will be studied as a subsection of surface discharge.  

\subsection{No Foils}
%BH
%fig 6.7
Nowadays, solid bushing is only used for voltages below 25kV. This is due to a combination of all factors as shown in the previous figure 6.7. When simulated with a conductor ten times its rated voltage its flaws are clear. As mentioned previously, the primary criteria to solve are high electric fields inducing partial discharges and large axial fields causing flashover.

This is best illustrated with figure 7.1, not only are the fields present at the interface to the flange well in excess of the PD inception voltage, the location of these high electric fields also mean flashover is a serious risk due to the lack of shaping of the axial electric field distribution. A result of such localised electric stress is that because the field is greater than the PD inception voltage the voids will generate exponentially more discharges, leading to faster ageing and a much higher chance of breakdown. The solution, assuming keeping voltage constant, would be to increase the bushing height and width. 
\subsection{No Grading}

The proposal to study a model of condenser bushing without any thought to grading exposes the fundamentals to grading design. Figure 7.2 shows that, for the most part the electric field is below the PD inception voltage, at least at the central interface. However looking at figures 6.11b and 6.11c show that the foil placement did not effectively shape the field at the bushing interface at the tips.  Beyond analysing the concentrations of electric field it is important to note that the distribution is non-linear; in comparison to the ideal goal of a linear drop of field across the capacitors \citep{kuffel2000high}. The placement of the outermost foil serves as a location of high field density and although located far from the flange itself it would likely be a source of both PDs and corona discharges.

\subsection{Comparison of Axial and Radial Grading Solutions}
The design of both types of capacitive grading method were discussed in the previous sections. The difference in performance of the types in general is the radial grading will improve the intensity of the radial electric field and the axial grading will improve the intensity of the axial electric field. By improvement of intensity of electric field, this means the electric field according to the type of grading method is evenly distributed in a particular direction. Choosing the right design for different application is essential as this will reduce the chances of various types of electrical breakdown and hence the bushing design would be more durable.

There are two components of electric field cause different problems. The radial electric field is mainly responsible to the breakdown of insulating material, for example, electrical breakdown between foils. On the other hand, the axial electric field is mainly responsible to the surface discharges along the boundary of the insulation, for example, corona discharge to the surrounding.

\subsubsection{Radial Electric Field}
The maximum intensity of the radial electric field for the radial design is expected to be lower than the maximum of the axial design. This means the radial grading design would perform better to suppress the intensity of radial electric field. The radial electric field across the radial direction of both axial and radial grading designs are shown in figure \ref{figure:rfield}.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{R-field.jpg}
\caption{Radial electric field across the mid-point of the two designs of bushing.}
\label{figure:rfield}
\end{figure}

The result clearly shows the peak value of electric field for the axial design ($\approx 4.5 \times 10^3 kVm^{-1}$) is greater than the peak value of electric field for the radial design ($\approx 3.5 \times 10^3 kVm^{-1}$). Also, from the figure \ref{figure:rfield}, the radial electric field of the radial grading design is more evenly distributed. This is the effect of grading, hence similar effect should be seen in the axial electric for axial grading design. The electric field distribution across any perpendicular cut lines to the foils would result in almost identical results, because the foils behave similar to capacitors in series. Electric field being constant across a capacitor and this is true across any two neighbouring foils.

\subsubsection{Axial Electric Field}
The axial component of electric field is responsible for the surface discharges along the surface of the bushing design. Axial component of the field contributes to these surfaces, because the axial electric field at the edges of the foil are the most intense. Figure \ref{figure:afield} shows the magnitude of electric field at each foil edge. 

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{A-field.jpg}
\caption{Electric field at the edge of each foil.}
\label{figure:afield}
\end{figure}
%this graph is a mess, I took very long time to convince myself to put this on here. This is the best I can do at the moment

The result shows the radial design has a lower peak value of electric field at these edges of foil. However, this is not an expected result, because axial grading in theory shapes the surface of the insulation better to avoid intensifying of electric field at these edges. Also, a clearer maximum peak of electric field at should be seen at the outermost foil of the radial graded design due to the sharp turn in the shape of the bushing design. Although the result shows a maximum peak at the last outermost foil, it is not significant and it is below the maximum value of electric field for the axial graded design. Although the radial graded design has lower maximum electric field than the axial graded design, the electric field generally is much greater than the electrical breakdown strength of air. This will result in surface discharges.

\subsubsection{Surface Flashover}
%talk about the addition of shedding in completeness. Limitations of current model without shedding -> primarily some extra shaping of fields. The effect of grounding the outermost capacitor.
%===============================================
Surface flashover is the partial discharge along the surface of the insulation, this is cause by a intense electric field. The parameter which takes into account of surface flashover is the creepage distance as mention previously. The typical value for calculating the creepage distance is 35mm/kV %need a reference for this prob%
and for more polluted environment, a higher value of creepage distance might be considered.

In bushing designs, the creepage distance is increased by the addition of a shed around the bushing. These shed designs increase the creepage distance of insulation designs by increasing the surface length.  Designs of shed can have varying ratios between creepage distance to axial length \cite{shed}, designs for more polluted environment have bigger ratios.

According to the typical value to calculate the creepage distance, for a 275kV design, the creepage distance required is 9625mm. Where the designs of bushing in this report has axial length of approximately 3m, the ratio of minimum nominal creepage distance to axial length required is 3.2:1.

These shed provides a greater creepage distance to reduce the chance of surface flashover, however, they have little affect on the electric field of the bushing. Hence, addition of shed does not reduce corona discharge. 

\subsection{Choice of Designing Method}

\section{Conclusions}
Conclusions.

%regarding area of interest of tips of foils a suggestion in (Graham?) was to line the capacitors with semiconductor material to more evenly spread out the field distribution.
