\section{Consequences of High Voltage} %Possibly a better heading needed
There are some consequences that need to be taken into account when designing system in high voltage. High voltage systems have much higher electric potential to their surrounding objects which are usually at earth potential, these arise electric potential gradient or electric field between the systems and their surrounding objects. The values of electric field can be extremely high due to the high voltage and may cause electrical breakdown and partial discharge which can lead to failure in systems. It is important to design system to minimise the chance of these events.

\subsection{Electrical Breakdown}
The electrical breakdown is the action of electrical conduction across a non-conductive medium from high potential object to object of lower potential. This usually happens when the potential difference is high and arcing can usually be seen in fluid medium. This can cause changes to the compounds in the non-conductive medium and also damage the system's equipments. For example,
