The advantages to work in high voltages come with drawbacks,one of the major drawbacks is the increase in complexity of required insulation system associated with voltage level. In high voltage transformer, bushings are required to avoid various electrical breakdown mechanisms caused by the potential difference from equipments to the surrounding earth objects i.e. transformer casing.
