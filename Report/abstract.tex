The advantages to work in high voltages come with drawbacks,one of the major drawbacks is the increase in complexity of required insulation system associated with voltage level. In high voltage transformer, bushings are required to avoid various electrical breakdown mechanisms caused by the potential difference from equipments to the surrounding earth objects i.e. transformer casing. This report start by discussing the different types of breakdown in high voltage systems and the stress control methods used in relatively lower voltages and DC systems. This report then focus on the high voltage AC solutions, capacitive stress control in bushing designs.
