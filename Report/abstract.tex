The advantages to work in high voltages come with drawbacks, one of the major drawbacks is the increase in complexity of required insulation system associated with voltage level. In high voltage transformer, bushings are required to avoid various electrical breakdown mechanisms caused by the potential difference from high potential equipments to the surrounding earth objects i.e. potential difference between the high voltage conducting cable and the transformer casing. This report starts by discussing the different types of breakdown in high voltage systems and the stress control methods used in relatively lower voltages and DC systems. High voltage AC solutions are discussed, derivation of capacitive stress control in bushing designs and simulated to illustrate the effects of the the two capacitive stress control methods.
